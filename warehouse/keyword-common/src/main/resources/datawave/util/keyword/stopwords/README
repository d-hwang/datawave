Stopwords Corpus for the YAKE Keyword Extraction Algorithm

This corpus contains lists of stop words for several languages.  These
are high-frequency grammatical words which are usually ignored in text
retrieval applications.

This corpus was obtained from:
https://github.com/apache/spark/tree/branch-3.4/mllib/src/main/resources/org/apache/spark/ml/feature/stopwords

Which in-turn were obtained from:
http://anoncvs.postgresql.org/cvsweb.cgi/pgsql/src/backend/snowball/stopwords/

The English list has been augmented
